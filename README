== Build ==

To build against the default Lua version 5.2, just run:
  make

Distributions like Ubuntu allow you to build against several versions of Lua. To select e.g. 5.1, run:
  make LUA_VERSION=5.1

If your system does not have multiple versions of Lua available (e.g. Gentoo), try this while omitting the version number:
  make LUA_VERSION=

If these do not fit you, you can configure CFLAGS and LIBS instead:
  make LUA_CFLAGS=-I... LUA_LIBS=-l...

== Example ==

For the minimal commandline example you will need lua-term [1].
Put it in the working directory when you try to run the example.
